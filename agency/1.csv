"<b>Agency 🏆</b>","<b>Definition:</b> The ability to take initiative and control one’s actions rather than waiting for direction.<br><br>
<b>Example:</b> A student struggling in a subject actively seeks solutions—watching tutorials, practicing, and asking questions—rather than waiting for the teacher.<br><br>
<b>Analogy:</b> 🚗 Driving a car vs. being a passenger—a person with agency controls their path, while a low-agency person passively follows.<br><br>
<b>🛠 Problem-Solving:</b><br>
✅ Identify areas where you tend to wait for instructions.<br>
✅ Take small independent actions without external prompting.<br>
✅ Surround yourself with proactive individuals.<br><br>
<b>📌 Application:</b><br>
🔹 If struggling with coding, instead of waiting for a course, start with online tutorials, build small projects, and seek peer feedback."

"<b>Learned Helplessness 😞</b>","<b>Definition:</b> A mindset where repeated failures lead to giving up, even when solutions exist.<br><br>
<b>Example:</b> A job seeker stops applying after multiple rejections, assuming failure is inevitable.<br><br>
<b>Analogy:</b> 🐘 An elephant tied with a thin rope—trained as a baby to believe escape is impossible, it never tries as an adult, despite its strength.<br><br>
<b>🛠 Problem-Solving:</b><br>
✅ Recognize when past failures are shaping your beliefs.<br>
✅ Set small, achievable challenges to rebuild confidence.<br>
✅ Seek new approaches rather than repeating past mistakes.<br><br>
<b>📌 Application:</b><br>
🔹 If struggling in math, switch study methods—use visual aids, practice in smaller chunks, or join study groups."

"<b>High-Agency Individual 🔥</b>","<b>Definition:</b> Someone who takes responsibility for challenges, finds solutions, and adapts to obstacles.<br><br>
<b>Example:</b> An entrepreneur without funding finds creative ways to bootstrap their startup instead of waiting for investors.<br><br>
<b>Analogy:</b> 🛠 MacGyver with a paperclip—high-agency individuals find solutions with whatever resources they have.<br><br>
<b>🛠 Problem-Solving:</b><br>
✅ Reframe obstacles as opportunities to innovate.<br>
✅ Solve problems proactively instead of waiting for guidance.<br>
✅ Cultivate resilience by viewing failures as learning experiences.<br><br>
<b>📌 Application:</b><br>
🔹 If a university doesn’t offer a program you want, organize a study group, start an independent research project, or propose a new course."

"<b>Low-Agency Individual 💤</b>","<b>Definition:</b> Someone who passively follows orders, avoids challenges, and depends on others for direction.<br><br>
<b>Example:</b> A student blames a poor grade on the teacher rather than improving study habits.<br><br>
<b>Analogy:</b> 🍂 A leaf in the wind—drifting wherever external forces take them instead of shaping their own path.<br><br>
<b>🛠 Problem-Solving:</b><br>
✅ Take ownership of your decisions and results.<br>
✅ Develop self-discipline by setting personal goals.<br>
✅ Challenge yourself to make independent choices.<br><br>
<b>📌 Application:</b><br>
🔹 If unhappy with your career, instead of waiting for the perfect job, upskill, network, and explore alternative paths."

"<b>Initiative ⚡</b>","<b>Definition:</b> Acting on an opportunity or solving a problem without waiting for instructions.<br><br>
<b>Example:</b> A programmer notices inefficiencies in a system and builds a tool to fix it, without being asked.<br><br>
<b>Analogy:</b> 🔥 Lighting a fire vs. waiting for the sun—initiators create opportunities rather than waiting for ideal conditions.<br><br>
<b>🛠 Problem-Solving:</b><br>
✅ Train yourself to spot inefficiencies and act on them.<br>
✅ Set personal deadlines to build a habit of proactive action.<br>
✅ Reward small acts of initiative to reinforce the behavior.<br><br>
<b>📌 Application:</b><br>
🔹 If your team lacks organization, take the initiative to create a workflow or task management system."

"<b>External Prompting ⏳</b>","<b>Definition:</b> Relying on others (teachers, bosses, deadlines) to take action instead of being self-motivated.<br><br>
<b>Example:</b> An employee only works when their manager checks in, instead of staying productive independently.<br><br>
<b>Analogy:</b> ⏰ Needing an alarm clock vs. waking up naturally—external vs. internal motivation.<br><br>
<b>🛠 Problem-Solving:</b><br>
✅ Develop routines that eliminate dependence on reminders.<br>
✅ Use internal motivation (personal goals) instead of external pressure.<br>
✅ Create accountability structures like self-imposed deadlines.<br><br>
<b>📌 Application:</b><br>
🔹 If you struggle with staying fit, instead of waiting for a coach, set personal fitness goals and track progress independently."

"<b>Growth Mindset 🚀</b>","<b>Definition:</b> The belief that intelligence and abilities improve with effort and learning.<br><br>
<b>Example:</b> A student struggling with physics keeps practicing, believing improvement is possible.<br><br>
<b>Analogy:</b> 💪 Muscles strengthening with exercise—abilities grow through consistent effort.<br><br>
<b>🛠 Problem-Solving:</b><br>
✅ Replace 'I can't do this' with 'I can't do this *yet*.'<br>
✅ Seek challenges that push you beyond your comfort zone.<br>
✅ View feedback as a tool for growth rather than criticism.<br><br>
<b>📌 Application:</b><br>
🔹 If learning a language, instead of fearing mistakes, embrace them as part of the learning process and actively practice speaking."
