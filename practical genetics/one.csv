Question,Answer
What is the principle of the phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol method?,"Phenol denatures proteins, chloroform separates phases, and isoamyl alcohol prevents foaming. DNA remains in the aqueous phase."
Why is isoamyl alcohol added to chloroform?,"To prevent foaming and stabilize the interface between aqueous and organic phases."
What is the role of SDS in DNA extraction?,"SDS disrupts cell membranes and denatures proteins, releasing DNA."
Why is ethanol used in DNA precipitation?,"Ethanol reduces DNA solubility, causing it to precipitate."
What precautions should be taken while handling phenol?,"Wear gloves, goggles, and work in a fume hood. Avoid skin contact and inhalation."
How can you detect DNA after isolation?,"Using spectrophotometry (260 nm) or gel electrophoresis with a DNA stain."
What does a 260/280 ratio indicate?,"~1.8 = pure DNA; <1.8 = protein contamination; >1.8 = RNA contamination."
What is the function of EcoRI?,"It recognizes GAATTC and cuts between G and A, producing sticky ends."
What are the components of a restriction digestion reaction?,"Plasmid DNA, EcoRI enzyme, 10x restriction buffer, and nuclease-free water."
What is the purpose of the 10x restriction buffer?,"It provides optimal pH, ionic strength, and cofactors for enzyme activity."
How do you calculate the amount of Tris base for 50 ml of 5 mM Tris-HCl?,"Amount = (5 mM) × (0.05 L) × (121.14 g/mol) = 0.0303 g."
How do you adjust the pH of Tris-HCl buffer?,"Add HCl dropwise while monitoring with a pH meter until pH 8.0 is reached."
What are the components of phosphate buffer?,"Monosodium phosphate (NaH₂PO₄) and disodium phosphate (Na₂HPO₄)."
How do you calculate the amounts of NaH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄ for 25 mM phosphate buffer?,"Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and a ratio of ~4:1 for pH 7.4."
Question,Answer
Why is proteinase K used in DNA extraction?,"It digests proteins, including nucleases, to release intact genomic DNA."
What is the purpose of adding EDTA in the lysis buffer?,"EDTA chelates divalent cations, preventing DNA degradation by nucleases."
Why is NaCl added during DNA extraction?,"It neutralizes negative charges on DNA, aiding in precipitation."
What happens if you over-dry the DNA pellet?,"The DNA pellet may become difficult to dissolve, leading to loss of DNA."
Why is RNAse treatment performed after DNA isolation?,"To degrade RNA contaminants, ensuring pure DNA preparation."
What is the significance of the 260/230 ratio?,"It indicates DNA purity with respect to organic contaminants (e.g., phenol)."
Why do DNA bands appear as smears on an agarose gel?,"Due to degradation, overloading, or improper gel running conditions."
What is the role of ethidium bromide in gel electrophoresis?,"It intercalates into DNA and fluoresces under UV light for visualization."
What are sticky ends, and why are they important?,"Single-stranded overhangs created by restriction enzymes; important for ligation."
What happens if you forget to add EcoRI in the digestion reaction?,"The plasmid DNA remains uncut, and no digestion products are observed."
How do you confirm successful plasmid digestion?,"Run on an agarose gel; successful digestion shows fragmented DNA bands."
Why is Tris-HCl buffer commonly used in molecular biology?,"It is effective in the pH range of 7.0–9.0 and is stable and non-toxic."
What happens if Tris-HCl buffer is prepared at the wrong pH?,"Enzymes and biomolecules may not function optimally, leading to failed experiments."
Why is phosphate buffer used in biological experiments?,"It is effective in the physiological pH range (6.0–8.0) and is biocompatible."
What is the pKa of phosphate buffer, and why is it important?,"The pKa is ~7.2, allowing it to maintain stable pH near physiological conditions."
