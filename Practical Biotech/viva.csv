What defines an organic acid?,"Organic acids are carbon-containing compounds with acidic properties, typically featuring a carboxyl group (–COOH). Examples include citric acid (C₆H₈O₇) and acetic acid (CH₃COOH). They are commonly found in biological systems and food products."  

What is the general formula of a carboxylic acid?,"R–COOH, where R is an alkyl or aryl group. Example: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH)."  

What is an acid-base conjugate pair?,"A pair of compounds related by the transfer of a proton (H⁺). The acid donates H⁺ to form its conjugate base, and the base accepts H⁺ to form its conjugate acid. Example: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) and acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻)."  

Write the conjugate base of H₂SO₄.,"HSO₄⁻ (hydrogen sulfate ion). H₂SO₄ donates one H⁺ to form HSO₄⁻."  

Write the conjugate acid of NH₃.,"NH₄⁺ (ammonium ion). NH₃ accepts one H⁺ to form NH₄⁺."  

Why do weak acids react with strong bases?,"Weak acids (e.g., CH₃COOH) partially dissociate in water, releasing H⁺ ions. Strong bases (e.g., NaOH) completely dissociate, providing OH⁻ ions. The OH⁻ ions neutralize H⁺ ions, driving the reaction to completion despite the weak acid’s partial dissociation."  

What is the net ionic equation for a weak acid-strong base reaction?,"HA (weak acid) + OH⁻ (strong base) → A⁻ (conjugate base) + H₂O. Example: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O."  

What is a neutralization reaction?,"A chemical reaction between an acid and a base to form a salt and water. Example: HCl (acid) + NaOH (base) → NaCl (salt) + H₂O."  

What is the difference between complete and partial neutralization?,"• Complete neutralization: All H⁺ ions from the acid react with OH⁻ ions from the base.  
• Partial neutralization: Only some H⁺ ions react, leaving excess acid or base."  

What is a standard solution?,"A solution with a precisely known concentration, used as a reference in titrations. Example: 0.1 N NaOH, prepared and standardized using a primary standard like potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP)."  

What is a primary standard?,"A highly pure, stable compound used to prepare or standardize solutions. Example: Potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) for standardizing NaOH solutions."  

What is the role of an indicator in titration?,"An indicator is a pH-sensitive dye that changes color at the endpoint, signaling the completion of the reaction. Example: Phenolphthalein changes from colorless (acidic) to pink (basic)."  

What are the properties of a good indicator?,"• Sharp color change at the endpoint.  
• Color change within the pH range of the titration.  
• Stable and non-reactive with the analyte or titrant."  

Give examples of acid-base indicators and their pH ranges.,"• Phenolphthalein: pH 8.2–10.0 (colorless to pink).  
• Methyl orange: pH 3.1–4.4 (red to yellow).  
• Bromothymol blue: pH 6.0–7.6 (yellow to blue)."  

What is a normal solution (N)?,"A solution containing 1 gram equivalent of solute per liter. Normality depends on the reaction context (e.g., for H₂SO₄, 1 M = 2 N in acid-base reactions)."  

How do you calculate normality (N)?,"N = Molarity (M) × n, where n = number of H⁺ or OH⁻ ions per molecule. Example: H₃PO₄ (n = 3) → 1 M = 3 N."  

How do you prepare 0.1 N NaOH?,"1. Weigh 4.0 g NaOH pellets.  
2. Dissolve in 1 L distilled water.  
3. Standardize using a primary standard (e.g., KHP) to confirm exact concentration."  

Why is standardization of NaOH necessary?,"NaOH absorbs CO₂ from air, forming Na₂CO₃, which reduces its effective concentration. Standardization ensures accuracy."  

Why dilute a high-concentration acid before titration?,"High-concentration acids may require excessive titrant, exceeding the burette’s capacity. Dilution ensures the reaction is manageable and within the titration range."  

What is the titration range?,"The pH range over which an indicator changes color, ideally matching the reaction’s equivalence point. Example: Phenolphthalein (pH 8.2–10.0) for weak acid-strong base titrations."  

What is the equivalence point in titration?,"The point where moles of acid = moles of base (stoichiometric completion). Example: 1 mole CH₃COOH reacts with 1 mole NaOH."  

What is the endpoint in titration?,"The point where the indicator changes color, signaling the reaction’s completion. It may slightly differ from the equivalence point."  

Why is phenolphthalein used in weak acid-strong base titrations?,"Its pH range (8.2–10.0) aligns with the equivalence point of weak acid-strong base reactions (pH > 7)."  

What is the difference between a strong acid and a weak acid?,"• Strong acid: Fully dissociates in water (e.g., HCl).  
• Weak acid: Partially dissociates (e.g., CH₃COOH)."  

What is the formula for normality (N)?,"N = Molarity (M) × n, where n = number of H⁺ or OH⁻ ions per molecule. Example: H₂SO₄ (n = 2) → 1 M = 2 N."  

What is a primary standard?,"A highly pure, stable compound used to standardize solutions. Example: Potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) for NaOH standardization."  

Why is CO₂ absorption a problem for NaOH solutions?,"CO₂ reacts with NaOH to form Na₂CO₃, reducing its effective concentration. Store NaOH in airtight containers."  

What is the purpose of a blank titration?,"To check for impurities or errors in the procedure by titrating without the analyte (e.g., water + indicator)."  

What is the pH at the equivalence point for weak acid-strong base titrations?,"pH > 7 (basic), as the conjugate base of the weak acid hydrolyzes water to produce OH⁻ ions."  

What is the difference between molarity and normality?,"• Molarity: Moles of solute per liter of solution.  
• Normality: Equivalents of solute per liter of solution (depends on reaction context)."  

What is the role of a buffer in titration?,"Buffers maintain a stable pH, but they are not used in simple acid-base titrations. They are used in pH-dependent processes."  

Why is a white tile used in titration?,"To provide a neutral background for clear observation of the indicator’s color change."  

What is the formula for calculating acid concentration in titration?,"Acid concentration = (Volume of base × Normality of base × Molar mass of acid) / Volume of acid."  

What is the difference between a monoprotic and polyprotic acid?,"• Monoprotic: Donates 1 H⁺ ion (e.g., HCl).  
• Polyprotic: Donates >1 H⁺ ion (e.g., H₂SO₄, H₃PO₄)."  

What is the purpose of rinsing glassware with the solution it will hold?,"To prevent contamination or dilution. Example: Rinse burette with NaOH before filling."  

What is the significance of the titration curve?,"It shows pH vs. volume of titrant added, helping identify the equivalence point and buffer regions."  

What is the role of a hydrometer in acid-base experiments?,"Optional: Measures solution density, but titration is more accurate for concentration determination."  

What is the difference between a weak base and a strong base?,"• Weak base: Partially dissociates (e.g., NH₃).  
• Strong base: Fully dissociates (e.g., NaOH)."  

What is the formula for calculating percentage acidity?,"% Acid = (grams of acid per liter / 1000) × 100. Example: 15 g/L = 1.5%."  

Why is a conical flask used in titration?,"Its narrow neck prevents splashing, and its shape allows efficient mixing during swirling."  

What is the role of a stir rod in titration?,"To manually mix solutions, though swirling the flask is preferred to avoid breakage."  

What is the purpose of a rinse bottle in titration?,"To wash down the sides of the flask, ensuring all acid/base reacts with the titrant."  

What is the difference between a titrant and an analyte?,"• Titrant: The solution added (e.g., NaOH).  
• Analyte: The solution being analyzed (e.g., citric acid)."  

What is the significance of the titration range for an indicator?,"It ensures the indicator’s color change aligns with the reaction’s equivalence point for accurate results."
