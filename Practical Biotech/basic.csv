What is titration?,"Titration is a laboratory method to determine the concentration of an unknown solution by reacting it with a solution of known concentration (standard solution)."  

What is a standard solution?,"A solution with a precisely known concentration, e.g., 0.1 N NaOH, used to titrate the analyte (citric acid or acetic acid)."  

What is the purpose of an indicator in titration?,"An indicator (e.g., phenolphthalein) changes color at the endpoint, signaling the reaction’s completion between the acid and base."  

Why is NaOH used in these experiments?,"NaOH is a strong base that reacts completely with weak acids (citric acid in lemon, acetic acid in vinegar) for accurate neutralization."  

What is the difference between normality (N) and molarity (M)?,"• Molarity = moles of solute per liter.  
• Normality = equivalents per liter. For NaOH, 1 M = 1 N (since it donates 1 OH⁻ ion)."  

What is the endpoint in titration?,"The point where the indicator changes color (e.g., colorless → pink) indicating the reaction is complete."  

Why is a burette used instead of a graduated cylinder?,"A burette allows precise measurement of small volume increments (0.1 mL accuracy), critical for titration accuracy."  

What is the role of a conical flask in titration?,"Its narrow neck prevents splashing, and its shape allows easy swirling to mix solutions without spilling."  

Why is distilled water used for dilution?,"Distilled water lacks ions that could react with the acid/base, ensuring no interference with the reaction."  

What does a 0.1 N NaOH solution mean?,"It contains 0.1 equivalents of NaOH per liter. For NaOH, 0.1 N = 0.1 M (since each molecule provides 1 OH⁻ ion)."  

What is a neutralization reaction?,"A reaction where an acid and base react to form salt and water. Example: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O."  

Why is lemon juice strained before titration?,"To remove pulp or seeds that could absorb acid or interfere with volume measurements."  

What is the first step in setting up a titration?,"Rinsing the burette with the titrant (NaOH) to avoid dilution errors from residual water."  

How do you read a burette accurately?,"Read at eye level, noting the bottom of the meniscus. Record to the nearest 0.05 mL (e.g., 25.00 mL)."  

What is the primary safety precaution when handling NaOH?,"Wear gloves and goggles—NaOH is corrosive and can cause burns."  

Why is phenolphthalein colorless in acidic solutions?,"In acidic conditions (pH < 8.2), phenolphthalein exists in a form that absorbs UV light but appears colorless to the eye."  

What is a triprotic acid?,"An acid that donates three protons (H⁺ ions) per molecule. Citric acid (C₆H₈O₇) is triprotic."  

Why does citric acid require 3 moles of NaOH per mole of acid?,"Citric acid has three acidic protons (triprotic), each reacting with one OH⁻ ion from NaOH: C₆H₈O₇ + 3NaOH → Na₃C₆H₅O₇ + 3H₂O."  

What is the purpose of a blank titration?,"A control experiment without the analyte (e.g., water + indicator) to check for impurities. Not required here but common in advanced labs."  

How is the molar mass of citric acid calculated?,"Sum the atomic masses: 6(12) + 8(1) + 7(16) = 192.13 g/mol."  

What happens if you overshoot the endpoint?,"Excess NaOH makes the solution too basic, leading to overestimation of acid content. The trial must be discarded."  

Why is the same pipette used for all samples?,"To minimize volume measurement errors. Different pipettes may have calibration variations."  

What is the difference between equivalence point and endpoint?,"• Equivalence point: Exact stoichiometric completion of the reaction.

What is a common error in burette handling?,"Not removing air bubbles from the tip, leading to inaccurate volume readings."  

Why is a white tile placed under the conical flask?,"To improve visibility of the indicator’s color change against a neutral background."  

What is the role of a hydrometer in citric acid estimation?,"Optional: Measures density to estimate acidity, but titration is more accurate and direct."  

Why must NaOH solutions be standardized?,"NaOH absorbs CO₂ from air, forming Na₂CO₃, which reduces its effective concentration over time."  

What is the molar ratio for acetic acid and NaOH?,"1:1. CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O."  

How does temperature affect titration results?,"High temperatures expand solutions, altering volumes. Perform titrations at room temperature."  

What is the key takeaway for titration calculations?,"Use stoichiometry: Moles of acid = moles of base × molar ratio (1:3 for citric acid, 1:1 for acetic acid)."  

What is a common misconception about acid strength?,"Weak vs. strong refers to dissociation, not concentration. Acetic acid is weak but can be highly concentrated."  

Why rinse glassware with the solution it will hold?,"Prevents contamination or dilution. Example: Rinse burette with NaOH before filling."  

What is the FDA requirement for vinegar acidity?,"At least 4% acetic acid by volume for commercial vinegar. Titration ensures compliance."  

How would expired NaOH affect results?,"Lower NaOH concentration due to CO₂ absorption → higher calculated acid content. Standardize before use."

What is a triprotic acid? Give an example.,"An acid that donates three H⁺ ions per molecule. Example: Citric acid (C₆H₈O₇)."  

Why is citric acid called a weak acid?,"It does not fully dissociate in water, releasing H⁺ ions partially (unlike strong acids like HCl)."  

What is the purpose of a beaker in titration?,"To hold excess titrant (e.g., NaOH) before transferring it to the burette."  

What is a rinse bottle used for?,"To wash down the sides of the conical flask during titration, ensuring all acid reacts with the base."

What is the role of a lab notebook?,"To record all data (volumes, observations) immediately, ensuring traceability and reducing errors."  

What is the difference between accuracy and precision?,"Accuracy: Closeness to the true value. Precision: Consistency of repeated measurements."  

Why use a standardized NaOH solution?,"To ensure its concentration is exact, as inaccuracies directly affect acid content calculations."
